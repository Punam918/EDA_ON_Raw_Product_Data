The tablet's 7.9"" Retina Display features a native resolution of 2048 x 1536, showing up to 3.1 million pixels at 326 ppi. The Retina Display's capacitive touchscreen lets you utilize all the multi-touch gestures of i OS. The mini 4 features Apple's A8 processor with their 2nd Generation 64-bit architecture, allowing for more robust and powerful apps such as video editing, 3D modeling and CAD, and 3D gaming. Also, the A8 chip supports Metal, a more efficient technology that enables the i Pad mini to render detailed graphics and visual effects. Accompanied by the A8 chip is the M8 motion coprocessor, which measures the motion of the i Pad mini via the accelerometer, gyroscope, compass, and barometer, lightening the load of the A8 chip. This frees up the A8 chip to process multiple tasks while enabling it to maintain fast performance. The i Pad mini may have the Retina Display, but it still manages to maintain its 10-hour battery life. That's because the A8 chip isn't just more powerful, it's also more efficient. The i Pad mini comes with i OS and Touch ID. Designed for the i Pad, i OS features News, enhanced multitasking, a shortcut bar, editing tools, updated multi-touch gestures, and more. Touch ID uses your fingerprint to unlock your device as well as make secure purchases in i Tunes, i Books, the App Store, and via Apple Pay. With i Cloud, you can sync your i Pad mini to your other i OS devices and Mac computers. Push photos, download apps, and continue from where you left off in i Books with i Cloud. i Cloud also offers cloud storage so you can back up your contacts, photos, and important documents to Apple's cloud servers. You can also restore your i Pad mini to a previous state using i Cloud.

Take your photos from wide to ultra wide. A redesigned interface uses the new Ultra Wide camera to show you what’s happening outside the frame — and lets you capture it. Shoot and edit videos as easily as you do photos. It’s the world’s most popular camera, now with a whole new perspective. Shoot and edit the highest-quality video in a smartphone. iPhone 11 shoots beautifully sharp 4K video at 60 fps across all its cameras. The Ultra Wide camera captures four times more scene, so it’s perfect for action shots like your dog catching a frisbee. If you’re recording a performance — say, your kid’s piano recital - when you zoom in, the audio zooms too. And now you can edit videos as easily as you do photos. New Ultra Wide camera. Go big — the new Ultra Wide camera captures four times more scene. Think breathtaking landscapes that go on forever. Capturing the entire stage and crowd at a music festival. And vacation shots that show the whole family — including the views you traveled 11,000 miles for. Introducing Night mode. Shooting in low light doesn’t have to be a shot in the dark. Night mode is a new feature that turns on automatically for low‐light photos like you’ve never seen. There’s no need for flash, colors are more natural, and photos are brighter. Take portraits to new places. With new kinds of portraits and more lighting controls, the dual cameras in iPhone 11 work together to create stunning images. And Portrait mode now works with everything you love to shoot — that includes your best friends, two‐legged or four. Next‐generation Smart HDR. Thanks to machine learning, Smart HDR is more intelligent than ever. It recognizes people and treats them differently from the rest of the shot. So faces have beautiful highlights, shadows, and natural‐looking skin tones. And that stunning sunset in the background still looks gorgeous. Start shooting video instantly with QuickTake. Take a video simply by holding the shutter while in photo mode. Then swipe to the right to continue recording. If you’re shooting outdoors, A13 Bionic can use machine learning to automatically track a moving subject. Introducing the slofie. Everything looks cooler at 120 fps, even if you’re just saying cheese, waving hi, or tossing your hair in the breeze. And now you can add more of everything to your selfies thanks to the new 12MP TrueDepth camera. Just turn your iPhone to landscape and the camera automatically zooms out to fit more in.","{""1_star"":5393,""2_stars"":1651,""3_stars"":3161,""4_stars"":11870,""5_stars"":87906}",647.760162412993,173.73,"[{""specification_name"":""Product Type"",""specification_value"":""Smartphone""},{""specification_name"":""Form Factor"",""specification_value"":""Touch""},{""specification_name"":""Protection"",""specification_value"":""Dustproof, splashproof, waterproof""},{""specification_name"":""Width"",""specification_value"":""3 in""},{""specification_name"":""Depth"",""specification_value"":""0.3 in""}]"

Compared to leather, its production accounts for significantly less carbon emissions. The cover easily snaps onto the iPhone and hugs it tightly without adding bulk. Thanks to integrated magnets that perfectly align with iPhone 15 Pro Max, clip-in feels magical every time and wireless charging is faster. When you need to charge the iPhone, just clip the MagSafe charger to it with the cover in place or place it on the Qi charger. Every Apple casehas undergone thousands of hours of testing during design and manufacturing. That why it not only looks good, but mainly protects the iPhone in the event of a fall and scratches. This iPhone cover is high quality and durable. FineWoven material may show signs of wear over time as its fibers are subjected to pressure during normal use. Some scratches may diminish over time. Connecting MagSafe accessories creates tiny footprints. These phenomena do not occur with a silicone or transparent cover on the iPhone 15 Pro Max.","{""1_star"":124,""2_stars"":41,""3_stars"":47,""4_stars"":130,""5_stars"":889}",15.99,22.35,"[{""specification_name"":""Material"",""specification_value"":""FineWoven""},{""specification_name"":""Color"",""specification_value"":""Evergreen""},{""specification_name"":""Product Recycled Content"",""specification_value"":""68 % - made of post-consumer recycled content""},{""specification_name"":""Type"",""specification_value"":""Protective cover""},{""specification_name"":""Recommended Use"",""specification_value"":""For cell phone""}]"

Shoot and edit videos as easily as you do photos. It’s the world’s most popular camera, now with a whole new perspective. Shoot and edit the highest-quality video in a smartphone. iPhone 11 shoots beautifully sharp 4K video at 60 fps across all its cameras. The Ultra Wide camera captures four times more scene, so it’s perfect for action shots like your dog catching a frisbee. If you’re recording a performance — say, your kid’s piano recital - when you zoom in, the audio zooms too. And now you can edit videos as easily as you do photos. New Ultra Wide camera. Go big — the new Ultra Wide camera captures four times more scene. Think breathtaking landscapes that go on forever. Capturing the entire stage and crowd at a music festival. And vacation shots that show the whole family — including the views you traveled 11,000 miles for. Introducing Night mode. Shooting in low light doesn’t have to be a shot in the dark. Night mode is a new feature that turns on automatically for low‐light photos like you’ve never seen. There’s no need for flash, colors are more natural, and photos are brighter. Take portraits to new places. With new kinds of portraits and more lighting controls, the dual cameras in iPhone 11 work together to create stunning images. And Portrait mode now works with everything you love to shoot — that includes your best friends, two‐legged or four. Next‐generation Smart HDR. Thanks to machine learning, Smart HDR is more intelligent than ever. It recognizes people and treats them differently from the rest of the shot. So faces have beautiful highlights, shadows, and natural‐looking skin tones. And that stunning sunset in the background still looks gorgeous. Start shooting video instantly with QuickTake. Take a video simply by holding the shutter while in photo mode. Then swipe to the right to continue recording. If you’re shooting outdoors, A13 Bionic can use machine learning to automatically track a moving subject. Introducing the slofie.

Take your photos from wide to ultra wide. A redesigned interface uses the new Ultra Wide camera to show you what’s happening outside the frame — and lets you capture it. Shoot and edit videos as easily as you do photos. It’s the world’s most popular camera, now with a whole new perspective. Shoot and edit the highest-quality video in a smartphone. iPhone 11 shoots beautifully sharp 4K video at 60 fps across all its cameras. The Ultra Wide camera captures four times more scene, so it’s perfect for action shots like your dog catching a frisbee. If you’re recording a performance — say, your kid’s piano recital - when you zoom in, the audio zooms too. And now you can edit videos as easily as you do photos. New Ultra Wide camera. Go big — the new Ultra Wide camera captures four times more scene. Think breathtaking landscapes that go on forever. Capturing the entire stage and crowd at a music festival. And vacation shots that show the whole family — including the views you traveled 11,000 miles for. Introducing Night mode. Shooting in low light doesn’t have to be a shot in the dark. Night mode is a new feature that turns on automatically for low‐light photos like you’ve never seen. There’s no need for flash, colors are more natural, and photos are brighter. Take portraits to new places. With new kinds of portraits and more lighting controls, the dual cameras in iPhone 11 work together to create stunning images. And Portrait mode now works with everything you love to shoot — that includes your best friends, two‐legged or four. Next‐generation Smart HDR. Thanks to machine learning, Smart HDR is more intelligent than ever. It recognizes people and treats them differently from the rest of the shot. So faces have beautiful highlights, shadows, and natural‐looking skin tones. And that stunning sunset in the background still looks gorgeous. Start shooting video instantly with QuickTake. Take a video simply by holding the shutter while in photo mode. Then swipe to the right to continue recording. If you’re shooting outdoors, A13 Bionic can use machine learning to automatically track a moving subject. Introducing the slofie. Everything looks cooler at 120 fps, even if you’re just saying cheese, waving hi, or tossing your hair in the breeze. And now you can add more of everything to your selfies thanks to the new 12MP TrueDepth camera. Just turn your iPhone to landscape and the camera automatically zooms out to fit more in.","{""1_star"":5792,""2_stars"":1740,""3_stars"":3300,""4_stars"":12184,""5_stars"":89956}",647.760162412993,173.73,"[{""specification_name"":""Product Type"",""specification_value"":""Smartphone""},{""specification_name"":""Form Factor"",""specification_value"":""Touch""},{""specification_name"":""Protection"",""specification_value"":""Dustproof, splashproof, waterproof""},{""specification_name"":""Width"",""specification_value"":""3 in""},{""specification_name"":""Depth"",""specification_value"":""0.3 in""}]"

Measuring just 0.5"" (13.1mm) thin and weighing only 2 pounds, the MacBook is compact yet still has a premium feel, thanks to its unibody design. The MacBook features a 12"" Retina display with a 16:10 aspect ratio and 2304 x 1440 native resolution, which results in 226 pixels per inch (ppi). The display also has 178°-wide viewing angles. To deliver the total Retina experience on the MacBook, Apple redesigned the pixels to create a larger aperture, allowing more light to pass through. This enabled Apple to use LED backlighting that's 30 percent more energy efficient than the displays on other Mac notebooks with no loss in brightness. Inside the MacBook you'll find the 6th-Gen (Skylake) Intel Core m3 processor, which is designed with 14-nanometer process technology. This means that the chip is packed with more transistors than the previous generation, for higher density and more efficient performance. Since the Intel Core m3 only draws 5 watts of power and generates less heat than its predecessors, Apple is able to omit the fan. Instead, the logic board, which is 67% smaller than the one in the 11"" MacBook Air, is seated on top of an anisotropic graphite sheet, which helps disperse any heat that is generated out, to the sides. No fan also means the MacBook will be virtually silent. Even with its miniaturized internal components, the MacBook has an impressive capacity, featuring 8GB of fast, power-efficient 1866 MHz LPDDR3 onboard RAM and 256GB of PCIe-based flash storage.","{""1_star"":44,""2_stars"":32,""3_stars"":126,""4_stars"":572,""5_stars"":3071}",1299.0,1411.04,"[{""specification_name"":""_manufacturer"",""specification_value"":""Apple""},{""specification_name"":""_category"",""specification_value"":""Notebooks""},{""specification_name"":""Input"",""specification_value"":""AC 120/230 V ( 50/60 Hz )""},{""specification_name"":""Output"",""specification_value"":""29 Watt""},{""specification_name"":""Graphics Processor"",""specification_value"":""Intel HD Graphics 515""}]"

A13 Bionic is an incredibly fast chip. So everything feels fluid, whether you're launching apps, playing the latest games, or exploring new ways to work and play with augmented reality. The advanced camera system with A13 Bionic brings you Portrait mode, which artfully blurs the background to put the focus on your subject - even when you're taking selfies. Next‐generation Smart HDR knows a face when it sees one and intelligently relights it to capture more natural-looking contours and skin tones. It also finesses highlight and shadow detail in the background. So every part of your photo looks amazing. 4K video means you'll see four times more detail than in 1080p HD video. And extended dynamic range adds greater detail in highlights and shadows. Touch ID lets you securely unlock your iPhone and sign in to apps instantly. All without reaching for your credit card. iPhone SE is water-resistant to 1 meter for 30 minutes. It's not afraid of a little coffee, tea, or soda either. And dust? No worries. The show must go on. So iPhone SE lets you watch up to 13 hours of video on a single charge. When you do need to power up, just set it down on a wireless charger.","{""1_star"":1566,""2_stars"":560,""3_stars"":1096,""4_stars"":4336,""5_stars"":18661}",647.760162412993,164.3,"[{""specification_name"":""Product Type"",""specification_value"":""Smartphone""},{""specification_name"":""Manufacturer Model Number"",""specification_value"":""A2275""},{""specification_name"":""Form Factor"",""specification_value"":""Touch""},{""specification_name"":""Protection"",""specification_value"":""Dustproof, water-resistant, splash-resistant""},{""specification_name"":""Width"",""specification_value"":""2.6 in""}]"

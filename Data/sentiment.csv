Take your photos from wide to ultra wide. A redesigned interface uses the new Ultra Wide camera to show you what’s happening outside the frame — and lets you capture it. Shoot and edit videos as easily as you do photos. It’s the world’s most popular camera, now with a whole new perspective. Shoot and edit the highest-quality video in a smartphone. iPhone 11 shoots beautifully sharp 4K video at 60 fps across all its cameras. The Ultra Wide camera captures four times more scene, so it’s perfect for action shots like your dog catching a frisbee. If you’re recording a performance — say, your kid’s piano recital - when you zoom in, the audio zooms too. And now you can edit videos as easily as you do photos. New Ultra Wide camera. Go big — the new Ultra Wide camera captures four times more scene. Think breathtaking landscapes that go on forever. Capturing the entire stage and crowd at a music festival. And vacation shots that show the whole family — including the views you traveled 11,000 miles for. Introducing Night mode. Shooting in low light doesn’t have to be a shot in the dark. Night mode is a new feature that turns on automatically for low‐light photos like you’ve never seen. There’s no need for flash, colors are more natural, and photos are brighter. Take portraits to new places. With new kinds of portraits and more lighting controls, the dual cameras in iPhone 11 work together to create stunning images. And Portrait mode now works with everything you love to shoot — that includes your best friends, two‐legged or four. Next‐generation Smart HDR. Thanks to machine learning, Smart HDR is more intelligent than ever. It recognizes people and treats them differently from the rest of the shot. So faces have beautiful highlights, shadows, and natural‐looking skin tones. And that stunning sunset in the background still looks gorgeous. Start shooting video instantly with QuickTake. Take a video simply by holding the shutter while in photo mode. Then swipe to the right to continue recording. If you’re shooting outdoors, A13 Bionic can use machine learning to automatically track a moving subject. Introducing the slofie. Everything looks cooler at 120 fps, even if you’re just saying cheese, waving hi, or tossing your hair in the breeze.

Filmmakers use a technique called rack focus — shifting focus from one subject to another — to guide the audience’s attention in their films. Now iPhone makes it easy for you to bring the same storytelling technique to your videos. Cinematic mode anticipates when a prominent new subject is about to enter the scene and automatically shifts focus when they do. Now you can effortlessly create videos that look and feel like the movies. The A15 Bionic and the TrueDepth camera also power Face ID, the most secure facial authentication in a smartphone. Want to change the focus or adjust the blur after shooting wraps? No problem, the iPhone lets you do it with a few taps and swipes.

Take your photos from wide to ultra wide. A redesigned interface uses the new Ultra Wide camera to show you what’s happening outside the frame — and lets you capture it. Shoot and edit videos as easily as you do photos. It’s the world’s most popular camera, now with a whole new perspective. Shoot and edit the highest-quality video in a smartphone. iPhone 11 shoots beautifully sharp 4K video at 60 fps across all its cameras. The Ultra Wide camera captures four times more scene, so it’s perfect for action shots like your dog catching a frisbee. If you’re recording a performance — say, your kid’s piano recital - when you zoom in, the audio zooms too. And now you can edit videos as easily as you do photos. New Ultra Wide camera. Go big — the new Ultra Wide camera captures four times more scene. Think breathtaking landscapes that go on forever. Capturing the entire stage and crowd at a music festival. And vacation shots that show the whole family — including the views you traveled 11,000 miles for. Introducing Night mode. Shooting in low light doesn’t have to be a shot in the dark. Night mode is a new feature that turns on automatically for low‐light photos like you’ve never seen. There’s no need for flash, colors are more natural, and photos are brighter. Take portraits to new places. With new kinds of portraits and more lighting controls, the dual cameras in iPhone 11 work together to create stunning images. And Portrait mode now works with everything you love to shoot — that includes your best friends, two‐legged or four. Next‐generation Smart HDR. Thanks to machine learning, Smart HDR is more intelligent than ever. It recognizes people and treats them differently from the rest of the shot. So faces have beautiful highlights, shadows, and natural‐looking skin tones. And that stunning sunset in the background still looks gorgeous. Start shooting video instantly with QuickTake. Take a video simply by holding the shutter while in photo mode. Then swipe to the right to continue recording. If you’re shooting outdoors, A13 Bionic can use machine learning to automatically track a moving subject. Introducing the slofie. Everything looks cooler at 120 fps, even if you’re just saying cheese, waving hi, or tossing your hair in the breeze. And now you can add more of everything to your selfies thanks to the new 12MP TrueDepth camera.

It is made of durable microtwill and feels like soft suede. FineWoven material is designed with the planet in mind - it contains more than 68% post-consumer recycled material. Compared to leather, its production accounts for significantly less carbon emissions. The cover easily snaps onto the iPhone and hugs it tightly without adding bulk. Thanks to integrated magnets that perfectly align with iPhone 15 Pro, clip-in feels magical every time and wireless charging is faster. When you need to charge the iPhone, just clip the MagSafe charger to it with the cover in place or place it on the Qi charger. Every Apple casehas undergone thousands of hours of testing during design and manufacturing. That why it not only looks good, but mainly protects the iPhone in the event of a fall and scratches. This iPhone cover is high quality and durable. FineWoven material may show signs of wear over time as its fibers are subjected to pressure during normal use. Some scratches may diminish over time. Connecting MagSafe accessories creates tiny footprints. These phenomena do not occur with a silicone or transparent cover on the iPhone 15 Pro.","{'1_star': 37, '2_stars': 14, '3_stars': 9, '4_stars': 38, '5_stars': 124}",15.99,20.89,"[{""specification_name"":""Material"",""specification_value"":""Microtwill, FineWoven""},{""specification_name"":""Color"",""specification_value"":""Evergreen""},{""specification_name"":""Product Recycled Content"",""specification_value"":""68 % - made of post-consumer recycled content""},{""specification_name"":""Type"",""specification_value"":""Protective cover""},{""specification_name"":""Recommended Use"",""specification_value"":""For cell phone""}]",iPhone,37,14,9,38,124,51

Take your photos from wide to ultra wide. A redesigned interface uses the new Ultra Wide camera to show you what’s happening outside the frame — and lets you capture it. Shoot and edit videos as easily as you do photos. It’s the world’s most popular camera, now with a whole new perspective. Shoot and edit the highest-quality video in a smartphone. iPhone 11 shoots beautifully sharp 4K video at 60 fps across all its cameras. The Ultra Wide camera captures four times more scene, so it’s perfect for action shots like your dog catching a frisbee. If you’re recording a performance — say, your kid’s piano recital - when you zoom in, the audio zooms too. And now you can edit videos as easily as you do photos. New Ultra Wide camera. Go big — the new Ultra Wide camera captures four times more scene. Think breathtaking landscapes that go on forever. Capturing the entire stage and crowd at a music festival. And vacation shots that show the whole family — including the views you traveled 11,000 miles for. Introducing Night mode. Shooting in low light doesn’t have to be a shot in the dark. Night mode is a new feature that turns on automatically for low‐light photos like you’ve never seen. There’s no need for flash, colors are more natural, and photos are brighter. Take portraits to new places. With new kinds of portraits and more lighting controls, the dual cameras in iPhone 11 work together to create stunning images. And Portrait mode now works with everything you love to shoot — that includes your best friends, two‐legged or four. Next‐generation Smart HDR. Thanks to machine learning, Smart HDR is more intelligent than ever. It recognizes people and treats them differently from the rest of the shot. So faces have beautiful highlights, shadows, and natural‐looking skin tones. And that stunning sunset in the background still looks gorgeous. Start shooting video instantly with QuickTake. Take a video simply by holding the shutter while in photo mode. Then swipe to the right to continue recording. If you’re shooting outdoors, A13 Bionic can use machine learning to automatically track a moving subject. Introducing the slofie. Everything looks cooler at 120 fps, even if you’re just saying cheese, waving hi, or tossing your hair in the breeze. And now you can add more of everything to your selfies thanks to the new 12MP TrueDepth camera. Just turn your iPhone to landscape and the camera automatically zooms out to fit more in.","{'1_star': 5752, '2_stars': 1744, '3_stars': 3260, '4_stars': 12168, '5_stars': 89958}",647.760162412993,218.05,"[{""specification_name"":""Product Type"",""specification_value"":""Smartphone""},{""specification_name"":""Form Factor"",""specification_value"":""Touch""},{""specification_name"":""Protection"",""specification_value"":""Dustproof, splashproof, waterproof""},{""specification_name"":""Width"",""specification_value"":""3 in""},{""specification_name"":""Depth"",""specification_value"":""0.3 in""}]",iPhone,5752,1744,3260,12168,89958,7496

Take your photos from wide to ultra wide. A redesigned interface uses the new Ultra Wide camera to show you what’s happening outside the frame — and lets you capture it. Shoot and edit videos as easily as you do photos. It’s the world’s most popular camera, now with a whole new perspective. Shoot and edit the highest-quality video in a smartphone. iPhone 11 shoots beautifully sharp 4K video at 60 fps across all its cameras. The Ultra Wide camera captures four times more scene, so it’s perfect for action shots like your dog catching a frisbee. If you’re recording a performance — say, your kid’s piano recital - when you zoom in, the audio zooms too. And now you can edit videos as easily as you do photos. New Ultra Wide camera. Go big — the new Ultra Wide camera captures four times more scene. Think breathtaking landscapes that go on forever. Capturing the entire stage and crowd at a music festival. And vacation shots that show the whole family — including the views you traveled 11,000 miles for. Introducing Night mode. Shooting in low light doesn’t have to be a shot in the dark. Night mode is a new feature that turns on automatically for low‐light photos like you’ve never seen. There’s no need for flash, colors are more natural, and photos are brighter. Take portraits to new places. With new kinds of portraits and more lighting controls, the dual cameras in iPhone 11 work together to create stunning images. And Portrait mode now works with everything you love to shoot — that includes your best friends, two‐legged or four. Next‐generation Smart HDR. Thanks to machine learning, Smart HDR is more intelligent than ever. It recognizes people and treats them differently from the rest of the shot. So faces have beautiful highlights, shadows, and natural‐looking skin tones. And that stunning sunset in the background still looks gorgeous. Start shooting video instantly with QuickTake. Take a video simply by holding the shutter while in photo mode. Then swipe to the right to continue recording. If you’re shooting outdoors, A13 Bionic can use machine learning to automatically track a moving subject. Introducing the slofie. Everything looks cooler at 120 fps, even if you’re just saying cheese, waving hi, or tossing your hair in the breeze. And now you can add more of everything to your selfies thanks to the new 12MP TrueDepth camera. Just turn your iPhone to landscape and the camera automatically zooms out to fit more in.","{'1_star': 5792, '2_stars': 1740, '3_stars': 3300, '4_stars': 12184, '5_stars': 89956}",647.760162412993,173.73,"[{""specification_name"":""Product Type"",""specification_value"":""Smartphone""},{""specification_name"":""Form Factor"",""specification_value"":""Touch""},{""specification_name"":""Protection"",""specification_value"":""Dustproof, splashproof, waterproof""},{""specification_name"":""Width"",""specification_value"":""3 in""},{""specification_name"":""Depth"",""specification_value"":""0.3 in""}]",iPhone,5792,1740,3300,12184,89956,7532

It also finesses highlight and shadow detail in the background. So every part of your photo looks amazing. 4K video means you'll see four times more detail than in 1080p HD video. And extended dynamic range adds greater detail in highlights and shadows. Touch ID lets you securely unlock your iPhone and sign in to apps instantly.
